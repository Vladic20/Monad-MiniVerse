Monad MiniVerse: Your Universe of Thrill and Uniqueness
Welcome to Monad MiniVerse — an exhilarating world where luck, strategy, and creativity collide. This isn’t just a project; it’s a mini-universe where every dice roll, every roulette spin, and every minted NFT becomes part of your legend. Powered by the Monad blockchain, we offer you an arena for thrilling duels, stylish avatars, and the chance to hit it big.

The Three Pillars of Monad MiniVerse
Dice Duel: The Roll That Decides It All
The Core: Prove your prowess in a one-on-one showdown. Create a game or join an existing one with bets ranging from 0.1 to 100 MON. Two dice, two players, one victor.
Mechanics: Roll the dice (2d6), compare scores. The winner takes 90% of the pot, while 10% fuels the MiniVerse treasury to keep our universe thriving. A tie? Bets are refunded.
Vibe: Tension, risk, triumph—every roll is a dare to fate. Check the open games list and make your move!
Roulette Rush: The Color of Your Luck
The Core: Red or black? Place your bet from 0.1 to 100 MON, spin the wheel, and double your winnings.
Mechanics: Blockchain-backed randomness picks the color. Guess right? You get x2 minus a 2% treasury cut. Your bets and top-10 leaderboard stats immortalize your feats.
Vibe: A whirlwind of adrenaline where one spin can crown you a leader or spark the next challenge.
NFT DiceMasters: Your Key to the Universe
The Core: Claim your exclusive "Monad DiceMaster" NFT. Only 10,000 available, each at 0.11 MON.
Mechanics: Simple ERC-721 minting with identical designs stored on IPFS. It’s more than an avatar—it’s your ticket to MiniVerse and a badge of honor.
Vibe: Build your collection, stand out among players, and wear the DiceMaster title with pride.
